Expressionz
===========

### What is Expressionz?
Not everything is known for sure about this, but what we know for certain is that it is an Adobe AIR application that allows to upload images to Facebook and Google Picasa simultaneously (and maybe allows syncing between them?)

### What was it intended to be?
Certainly more than what it does now..


### Why is it even here?
- To remind me again and again how naive a programmer I was then.. ;-).
- To prove that there used to Adobe Flex, MXML, Adobe AIR and I worked on them.
- Archival purpose.

### History
Developed by [@sharadb](https://github.com/sharadb) and [@saich](https://github.com/saich) during somewhere between late 2009 - late 2010 for an internal Adobe AIR app development competition in an organization we worked for during that period. While this wasn't the complete app we envisioned (I hope so), but this was all we could get done in a couple of days.

All credits to @sharadb for doing all the heavy-lifting.. :-)
